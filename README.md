## Summary

In this exercise, I was tasked with creating a machine learning model that uses a 10-day window of Bitcoin closing prices/fear and greed index that would predict the price of the 11th day. In the first model, I used the Fear and greed index to predict the 11th day which did not produce the most accurare prediction according to the evaluation metric (0.73 loss). Additionally, the real vs predicted data showed huge variations which means that this is not a reliable model to predict bitcoin closing price. On the other hand, using bitcoin closing prices to predict the 11th day was a reliable and more accurate model in comparison. The evaluation metric (0.0095 loss) is much lower than that of the first model. Additionally predicted vs. actual results are more in line than that of the first model. Therefore, the second model is a better model to use for investment descisions.
